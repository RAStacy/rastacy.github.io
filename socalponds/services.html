                <h2>Pond Maintenance</h2>
                
    			<p>No matter what your pond installer told you... ponds require care in order to look their best. Often times people assume the pond can handle too many fish and the filter and pump never needs to be cleaned. This is far from the truth. Ponds needs to be cared for just like your lawn or surrounding landscapes.  I have been to many ponds that have never had their filter cleaned in over 4+ years, rarely clean their external pump basket, or trim the plants and the waterfall is barely flowing, the plants are overgrown and the pond is either green or covered with string algae. We suggest establishing some sort of regular weekly maintenance schedule to help you get in the habit of cleaning the skimmer, the pump basket (if pond has an external skimmer) removed fallen leaves, trim and fertilize the aquatic plants and inspect the under water lights. If the pond owner stays with a weekly schedule it should only take 10-30 minutes for an average sized pond and another 30 minutes to sit back and enjoy your work.</p>
    
    			<p>When we perform pond maintenance for our regular maintenance clients we do the following tasks:</p>
                
                <ul id="tasks">
        			<li>Survey the pond for any noticeable problems or concerns such as low water level, low water flow in the stream or waterall, take note of plant and aquatic life, and abnormal pump noise.</li>
    				<li>If the pond is equipped with an external pump and filter we tend to those first, cleaning the pump basket and backwashing the filter.</li>
    				<li>Remove debris from pond skimmer and clean skimmer pads. If the pond is equipped with a internal pump located in the skimmer we would check for leaks or listen for any abnormal sounds such as grinding or whining sounds.</li>
    				<li>Trim plant life, removing dead or dying leaves, branches or blooms. Fertilize as needed.</li>
    				<li>Inspect fish and other aquatic inhabitants for unusual behavior such as flashing or jumping or unusual swimming.</li>
    				<li>Inspect under water lights and replace bulbs as needed. </li>
    			</ul>
    
    			<p>Over the years Dominic and So-Cal Ponds have worked with many Landscapers, General Contractors, Designers, Businesses and Home Owners to help achieve balance in the aquatic garden and surrounding landscape. We hope to add you to our list of satisfied client list.</p>
